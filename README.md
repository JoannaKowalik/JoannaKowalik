## 👋 Hello, I'm Joanna

### Looking to bridge my passion for coding and my eye for design, I am thrilled to be pursuing new opportunities in tech industry!  

📐 With seven years of experience in architecture, I have sharpened my attention to detail, problem-solving, and time management skills - all of which I am eager to apply to the dynamic field of web development and product design.

🖌 Since 2017, I have also been active as a freelance 3D artist, where I have not only refined my 3D software skills, but have also honed my project management style.

🎵 I like art and music, watching B-movies and making Halloween costumes!
